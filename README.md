I am an energetic and ambitious Full Stack Software Engineer specialising in Back End. My background combines creativity with a high level of technical knowledge and I love bringing these traits into my coding. I am passionate about writing code that is clean, tested and reusable utilising the SOLID principles.

## Key Technical Skill

C#, .NET 5.0, .NET Core 3.1, .NET Framework 4.8, JavaScript, nodeJS, React (limited), Design Patterns, Test Driven Development, Behaviour Driven Development, Agile Development, AWS, Docker, Microservices, MongoDB, Git, Github

## Skills

### Excellent communicator

I have run a number of workshops for TDD and BDD. All attendees are now much stronger advocates for its use and implement it in their daily development.

As a former Physics teacher, I had to deliver complex material to students in a way that they would each understand, often having to change tactic mid lesson in order to ensure maximum learning could be achieved.

### Thrives under pressure

From having to complete huge cross team projects with very tight deadlines, to organising multiple year group school trips consisting of hundreds of students, I have always thrived when working under pressure. It is my strong organisational and time management skills that I have developed over time that allows me to do this.

### Fast learner

Software development is a very fast paced environment in which you have to learn quickly or risk being left behind. I pride myself in being able to pick up material quickly and apply it to real world situations. When at Makers Academy for the [Thermostat project](https://github.com/alexanderwjrussell/thermostatJS) it was required to learn JavaScript, CSS and Jasmine test framework in 1 week without aid from the course leader.

### Analytical thinker

As a Physics graduate who specialised in the theoretical Physics it was often required to analyse data and hypothesise the reasoning as to any emerging patterns. Also, from my background in mechanical engineering it is often required to think around a problem and develop solutions based on materials available at hand.

## Experience

### CompareTheMarket (Feb '17 - present)

I joined Compare the Market in February 2017 following graduation from Makers Academy where I retrained as a Junior Software Engineer. During my time at Compare the Market, I have been known as an outgoing, caring individual with an emphasis on Software Engineering best practices and collaboration across teams.

I have run workshops on TDD and BDD for apprentices and Junior Software Engineers in Tech, and in the Learning Month of 2019 I ran a collaboration exercise featuring one of my passions in life; board gaming. In that vein, I have also hosted many board game evenings in Compare the Market which are fully inclusive. I believe this has enabled me to create a strong network of people across the company who I can seek advice and help from and makes CTM a great place to work.

In the early days of the Code Club I co-hosted the Nassington School Code Club drawing on previous experience as a former teacher. I like to carry forward my past career skills in the form of mentoring at CTM and as such I have mentored Apprentices and Juniors in the past as well as on boarding our latest team members.

During my time at CTM, I have gained experience in several languages and disciplines, most notably C#, .NET Core, .NET 5.0, NodeJS, Docker and I am a keen advocate of TDD, pairing and the SOLID principles.
