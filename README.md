I am an energetic and ambitious **Full Stack Junior Developer**, looking for a role where I can consolidate and extend my programming knowledge. My background combines creativity with a high level of technical knowledge and I love bringing these traits into my coding. I am passionate about writing code that is clean, tested and reusable utilising the SOLID principals.

Having recently completed the intensive 12 weeks of [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/), I have grown from an interested amateur coder into a competent and confident junior developer.

I am currently looking to take on a career in the tech scene, where I can further expand my knowledge in Full-Stack and Back-End development and design.

**Tech Skills** : Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Sinatra, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, PostgreSQL

## Skills

#### Excellent communicator

During my time as a Physics teacher, I had to deliver complex material to students in a number of different ways utilising multiple techniques to ensure maximum learning could be achieved. Also, during my time working as a mechanical engineer, teamwork was a huge part. In order for teams to work effectively communication was vital. Being often given the task of team leader it fell to me to distribute work and ensure tasks were clearly defined and maintained.

#### Thrives under pressure

From having to organise multiple year group school trips consisting of hundreds of students, to completing group [projects](#projects), I have always thrived when working under pressure. It is my strong organisational and time management skills that I have developed over time that allows me to do this.

#### Fast learner

Makers Academy is a very fast paced environment in which you have to learn quickly or risk being left behind. I pride myself in being able to pick up material quickly and apply it to real world situations. For the [Thermostat project](https://github.com/alexanderwjrussell/thermostatJS) it was required to learn JavaScript, CSS and Jasmine test framework in 1 week without aid from the course leader.

#### Analytical thinker

As a Physics graduate who specialised in the theoretical Physics it was often required to analyse data and hypothesise the reasoning as to any emerging patterns. Also, from my background in mechanical engineering it is often required to think around a problem and develop solutions based on materials available at hand.

#### Additional skills

 - Methodologies : Agile (Scrum and Kanban), Test Driven Development, XP
 - Foreign languages : Basic Japanese and French
